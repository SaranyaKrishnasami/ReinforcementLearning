**Notebook 1: GridWorld Environment and Q-Learning**

Introduction to GridWorld
Overview: Introduction to the GridWorld environment, a grid-based setting where an agent navigates to achieve goals. This environment is used to demonstrate RL concepts and algorithms.
Reinforcement Learning Concepts
Fundamentals: Explanation of key RL concepts including states, actions, rewards, and policies. The notebook outlines how the agent learns by interacting with the GridWorld.
Implementation: Q-Learning
Algorithm Description: Detailed implementation of the Q-learning algorithm. It is an off-policy method that updates the Q-values (state-action values) using the Bellman equation to improve the policy.
Code: Python code demonstrating the Q-learning algorithm, including initialization, action selection (ε-greedy policy), Q-value updates, and training loop.
Visualization: Plots and visualizations showing the agent’s learning progress, Q-value convergence, and policy improvement over time.
Results and Analysis
Performance Metrics: Evaluation of the Q-learning algorithm’s performance in GridWorld. Analysis includes learning curves, convergence rates, and the effectiveness of the learned policy.
Comparison: Discussion on how Q-learning performs in terms of efficiency and accuracy compared to other RL methods.


**Notebook 2: SARSA and Other RL Techniques**
Introduction to Reinforcement Learning
Basics: Overview of reinforcement learning principles, including the agent-environment interaction model, and the learning process.
Markov Decision Processes (MDP)
MDP Overview: Explanation of MDP components—states, actions, rewards, and policies. This provides a theoretical foundation for the RL algorithms implemented.
Implementation: SARSA
Algorithm Description: Detailed implementation of the SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) algorithm. SARSA is an on-policy method that updates Q-values based on the action taken by the agent according to the current policy.
Code: Python code demonstrating SARSA, including the policy update mechanism, action selection, and training process.
Visualization: Visualizations of the SARSA learning process, including how the agent’s behavior and policy evolve.
Monte Carlo and Temporal-Difference Learning
Monte Carlo Methods: Introduction to Monte Carlo techniques for learning value functions based on averaging sample returns.
Temporal-Difference Learning: Explanation of methods like Q-learning and SARSA, highlighting their hybrid nature combining Monte Carlo and dynamic programming concepts.
Policy Gradient Methods
Overview: Brief discussion on policy gradient methods and their role in directly optimizing policies through gradient ascent.
Results and Analysis
Performance Metrics: Analysis of the SARSA algorithm’s performance, including learning curves and policy effectiveness.
Comparison: Comparative discussion on the differences between SARSA and Q-learning, including insights on their convergence properties and policy quality.
